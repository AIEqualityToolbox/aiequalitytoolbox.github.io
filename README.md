# <AI & Equality> A Human Rights Toolbox

A one-stop anti-bias and discrimination website that will house a stand-alone interactive learning tool, coding notebooks, and community engagement forum for university students and  faculty to actively engage with data and Human Rights concepts in order to understand the linkages and impacts of algorithmic creation that better reflect human rights values.

 Our methodology includes a workshop consisting of a Human Rights module and code, outreach and community plan incorporating human rights concepts with data science.

Goal: to integrate  International Human Rights frameworks with current concepts of fairness for designing an educational tool for computer scientists.
